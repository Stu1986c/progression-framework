### About our engineering progression frameworks
The engineering progression framework is a tool that helps engineers and managers:
 - make development and career plans
 - talk about what we‚Äôre looking for from engineers in a consistent way
 - set a fair level of compensation

The framework is a compass, not a GPS.

It's meant to be helpful. It's not meant to be a rating system for humans, free from edge cases.

### How does it work?
The framework covers all the things we‚Äôre looking for from engineers at ENSEK. We‚Äôre interested in these five elements:
  - Mastery - Your ENSEK knowledge, subject matter expertise within your team and technical capability
  - Impact - The size, scope and value of what you deliver
  - Influence - How you change the world around you for the better
  - Comms & Feedback - How you interact with others
  - Leadership - How people around you become better and more impactful

We sort them into five levels, and we try to give specific examples of behaviours we expect for each. Basically, the more behaviours you show from your level, the more you‚Äôll progress.

Your manager will work with you on this. None of it will happen mysteriously behind closed doors. You‚Äôll agree what level of progression you‚Äôre going for and what you need to improve on with your manager. It should be clear how you‚Äôre doing relative to that at all times. The objectives supporting your progression will be tracked within Clear Review - collation of evidence towards progress made against each objective will be owned by yourself. Once again, your manager will be able to offer guidance on suitable evidence for each objective.

### Things to keep in mind
- There are many different ways to progress and be valuable to ENSEK as you grow, including deep technical knowledge and ability, technical leadership and people management. All are equally valuable paths in ENSEK's engineering team.
- The framework represents a career‚Äôs worth of progression, people shouldn‚Äôt expect to fly up it in 18 months!
- Engineering progression isn‚Äôt an exact science and there will always be some ambiguity.
- This isn‚Äôt a checklist ‚Äì it‚Äôs possible to progress up a level without showing all the behaviours in that level.
- There will be levels on top (eg ‚ÄòInventor of Android‚Äô or ‚ÄòAuthor of Go‚Äô), but we won‚Äôt add them until we need them.

### Give us your feedback!
This is only the first version of our framework and we really want your feedback.

We're particularly keen to add as many examples to the behaviours as possible, to further clarify them.
